# Real Time Chat App

## Description

This is a real time chat app that uses Socket.io and Node.js.

The app is designed to be a simple web chat app that can be injected into 
any website to enable realtime communication.

The front-end uses socket to communicate with the backend. The backend is 
hosted on Replit.com, but I have included the server code in the repository.

The backend runs on Node/Express and uses a Replit.com database to log users 
by their Socket ID and their given username.
